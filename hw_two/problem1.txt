A. Use the access mode O_RDWR with open() to open a file that can be both read from and written to.

B. This message queue name will fail because it contains multiple slashes. Queue names should contain
one back slash at the beginning of the name and no more.

C. To tell the OS to ignore a signal, you should pass SIG_IGN in the sa_handler. This is done by
creating the sigaction struct and then specifying struct_name.sa_handler = SIG_IGN. struct_name here
is the name of the struct.

D. A program can tell that mq_receive() returned because of a signal rather than a message through
the return value of -1, indicating an error. The errno of the error should be set to EINTR indicating
the call was interrupted from the signal handler.
